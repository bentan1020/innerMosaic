its so nice to feel that everything i worked for was worth it
"It's nice at the end of the day to get home and have dinner with the wife and kids, and then relax in the evening until bed time."
It was the most important because I need money to live.  If I didn't have this job I couldn't afford my house my car anything in my life.  This is a must.
It was the ladies supper at church. Not my church but my mom's church. She asked me to go with her to the first dinner with her a few months ago and I've gone with her to every one since then. I always have such a great time visiting with the ladies there. We made fast friends and it's something I look forward to every month.
It was spending time with my family. It was a good time.
it was really good.  i got such a buzz off from the endorphines!
"It was my son's birthday so I spent the whole day doing things he wanted to do. It was so much fun watching him be excited by things and having a great time. At the end of the day, when I was tucking him in, he gave me the most serious and heartfelt thank I think he's ever given."
"It was just one of those days that didn't seem to really be active. The kids were at school, but came home all hyped up. Didn't want to settle to do school work, wanted to fight with one another. They hated dinner.But that night we were able to refocus on what needed to be done which is attend church."
"It was just another day at work, where I didn't know if I would make good money or not so good money."
It was a great workout that made me feel worthwhile.
It was a good day worked out felt more energized and had a good overall workout
It was a frustrating day yesterday. My brother and I were unable to complete the repairs to my car and are going to have to work on it again this weekend. I also didn't make much money at my online job and didn't have time to put in a lot of work there.
"It was a day like any other, I went to work very early, I left very tired, but in the afternoon I felt a little nostalgic for my family, my parents and brothers live far away, lately we have not had the best of relationships and that puts me Nostalgic and sad."
"It turned out to be a sunny and cooler day today, not rain like was expected. I got a really great hike in with the dog and was able to wear her out so she was behaved."
It is a challenge to have the family together and have them get along.  There are many differences between the children but they do want to participate in activities together.  I think that if they could just figure out how to help each other and that they could make a good team that they will be best friends.  Sometimes they surprise me with their time together and kindness and sharing with each other.  Other times they cause a lot of excitement and frustration in trying to get them to work together.  I am happy when they all can be together and enjoy each other.
It always makes me feel accomplished to see my family and how well they are doing.
In the morning I was able to complete my first workout since breaking my ankle a couple weeks ago. It was a good start and motivation to keep going. .
"In an effort to continue to try new things as it relates to freelance work I did a gig yesterday for a show being setup in Tampa. I found that the lady that hired me treats workers as slaves, talks down to us, and doesn't appear to believe any of use had brains. I'm not certain if this was based on previous experiences or her personality, but it made for a long ten hour day and many frustrations. I never walk out on jobs, because I believe I can learn something new from every experience and try to do this with each undertaking. Tomorrow is a fresh day with new horizons to conquer, so let's see what it brings."
"Im in alot of pain, so I sleep alot more than usual yesterday.t was nice, until I woke up. Then I was hurting again."
"So yesterday, I spent most of my working time testing and debugging the new code I wrote to automatically log a user back in when they time out, AND run whatever command they were trying to run when the program realized they'd timed out. The login part works great! And the running the command part works too - as long as there's only ONE command. If a single action, like a click, triggers TWO commands - like for instance, if clicking anywhere in a widget selects it, and clicking a button within it also contacts the DB - then only the first one runs and I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY. I can't debug it because every time I pause the code to step through it, the behavior changes! I suppose that in itself helps me narrow it down some - it must be a timing issue in some way - but I'm really stumped. I'll work on it some more today, I guess. I hate bugs I can't trace well, I feel like I don't have a good handle on how to find them. I mostly just stare at the code until inspiration strikes."
I'm tired of having bad food. It's like there is nothing in the kitchen. Oatmeal was ok but to follow it up with tuna and mayo for lunch made me feel ill. Then sloppy joes for dinner? Too strange of a combination for me. Makes me angry.
I'm pregnant and need food. I was starving.
"I'm just returning from a trip to a beautiful, warm place and I have to spend the day in this gray, dull office looking at a computer screen and reading reports. So boring..."
I'm glad to be back home daily to a loving husband who doesn't make me angry.  My coworker today complain how her husband like and that always make me feel glad that I have one that is wonderful.
I'd been gripped by fear for two days. Something was wrong. I never feel like that. My intuition was on high alert. I turned to God in prayer. I asked for help and courage in faith. My prayer was heard.
I worked with my friend and we went three jobs and finished all three successfully. I then came home from those projects and worked on clearing bruch along my property line. That is looking much better now.
"I worked very hard yesterday and it paid off, as I am saving for a road trip"
I worked out which is really important to me. I have been working on my health lately.
I worked out in the morning and the afternoon even when I did not feel like it. once I started I felt better.
"I worked my shift at hospice yesterday. It was, as it often is, a combination of mundane tasks and meaningful moments. There were two patients that stand out in my memory. One was a woman who was virtually non-responsive; I was glad to be able to spend a little time with her. The other was a woman who told great stories about her life and then prayed for me. I feel grateful when I leave there, and satisfied that I've connected with others."
I worked hard yesterday.  I had a lot of things to take care of.  It felt good to get it all done.
"I worked from home yesterday and there was not much to do, so I spent a lot of time playing with our little 16-month old girl, Eleanor, while my wife was at work. We read books and watched a lot of Paw Patrol. It was plenty of fun!"
"I worked for twelve hours yesterday. It was long and kind of boring, but I felt satisfied when it was over."
I worked all day yesterday so it was one of few things I did yesterday but I do not consider this job one of the most important jobs I've had overall. It is important to me in that it is how I support myself. I still try my hardest and am conscientious at work.
I worked all day so it was the biggest part of my day. This caused me a high deal of stress because I had a lot of work. Frustration also grew because what happened was we had a deadline to meet and it seemed impossible at the time.
I worked 9 hours yesterday which was good because I got overtime pay. It was a fairly routine day but with a lot of variety so it went by quickly!
I work out. I did legs and it made me feel good!
"I work in a dog daycare and for 10 hours I'm in a loud smelly room with dogs fighting and defecating and trying to jump on me. Yesterday it was raining so we didn't get to even go outside for a run. I was exhausted and one of the dogs peed on my shoe, and it's the only pair I have so i knew it would mean I'd have wet shoes the next day. I was so exhausted and overwhelmed when I got off I cried in my car."
I work a long hard day and really enjoy my nights rest.
"I woke up early and exercised in the morning yesterday. I've been trying to make it a habit, so I was proud of myself for keeping it up. I was also very energized after I finished exercising! I think I'll be able to keep up exercising every morning, it was pretty fun and it'll be good for me in the long run."
I went walking in a state park yesterday with my family. We had a nice time. It was really nice and very relaxing. Just getting out the house felt nice/
I went to work like every other week day.  After work I went to my gym where I am a new member and exercised with two of my friends.  It was a good workout and I felt great about myself when I was done.
I went to the gym after work instead of just sitting and watching tv and felt good to get out of the house
I went to my parents house and my sister was also there with her daughters. It was a lot of fun to get to play with the kids and see my family.
I went to my MRI to find out about the spot on my pancreas.  I did not like it because I felt trapped in the machine.  When I got home I had a vertigo attack that I think was caused by being in the MRI for so long.
"I went to a scheduled appointment with my dermatologies yesterday for a laser treatment.  I had been told there was virtually no recovery time for this particular treatment, which proved to be the case.  I am alreay very pleased with the results an know they will be better with time."
"I went to a jazz club today for the first time in a long time. A friend of a friend was performing. It was cool. Good music, good drinks. It was nice to get out."

I went to a cardiologist yesterday and was given a heart monitor.  I was diagnosed with SVT.
I went out with my friend for pho around lunchtime. It felt great to hang out with a friend as I hadn't been able to see any friends for a while. We chatted and at for a little over an hour and it felt very cathartic to be able to hang out with them.
"I went hiking yesterday with Doug. It was a gorgeous fall day, we went to Turkey Creek and ended the hike by sitting next to the waterfall. I pushed myself beyond my comfort zone by taking the longer trail even though I had not planned to do that and was wiped out by the end of the hike. It made me so hungry and tired. I went to sleep very early."
I went for a walk. It was peaceful.
I went for a walk today. Our neighbor was walking Breslin and Breslin started up my driveway when he saw me. Breslin is a dog I have had to ask the owner to keep out of our yard previously but he is a beautiful and very nice dog. I reminded Breslin to stay out of our yard and his owner called him back. I then complimented Bres because he is such a good dog. The walk was special because I have not taken one for over a week. I do not know when it happened but I used to walk every day and now it is only occasionally. I like the thought of returning to the walk habits.
i went for a swim at the Y to try to cotinue work on a shoulder issue i have.  it was painful while doing it but i pushed through and the movement is definitely coming back.
"I went for a run last night, it was kind of scary because it's now dark when I get home from work. I did 2 and a quarter miles though."

"I was much proud about my work yesterday, as I was organizing a meeting and which was successfully done in order to sign up a project with the client."
"I was most proud of getting plenty of exercise yesterday at work. I walk a lot on my job anyways but yesterday, I walked about 22,000 steps and I felt good doing it. Of course, it was accumulated from vacuuming long hallways at the student housing building I work at. It was also from hauling trash bags to the receptacle. Along with that, was the mopping, dusting, So I feel I did a lot of good for my health."
I was in daily mass and there was a scripture reading that I felt was very relevant and spoke to me and made me calm.
I was helping my daughter with her homework yesterday. She has been working very hard to get prepared for college and I am very proud of her.

I was amazed at my connection with people and friends yesterday. They all seemed to be so alive and happy this was a very good day for friendliness for all. I love when there are days that are like that many people tend to keep to themselves otherwise anymore. I tend to turn to my friends more than family these days so they are quite needed in my life just talking to people alone can brighten my day if they seem to be able to talk.

"I took Abbie, my four year old daughter, to the library. We made a day out of it. I drove downtown and then we went in several shops and window shopped others. We had a great time capping it off with returning our books to the library and picking out new books. It is so great to see Abbie show a love of reading and to see just how much effort she puts into finding the perfect books for her. I feel proud as she is so excited to go to the library but then is so patient, well behaved and serious when we are in the library."

I love my job but it can be very frustrating when problems happen that are difficult to fix. It distracting and I need some time to myself to think through the problems.
"I have a home recording studio in my attic that I sometimes hire out as a side gig. I had a group of three friends that scheduled a session with me yesterday evening who did not show up and did not call to let me know they weren't going to make it. I treat it as a side business and act professionally and expect others who reserve my time to treat it seriously - I ended up staying in for the evening waiting on them. It was slightly more obnoxious than usual because they were not only ""clients"" but are friends and it was a pretty disrespectful thing to happen."
I have a degenerative disease Inclusion Body Myositis in my skeletal muscles and must exercise regularly to slow down the progression of the disease and this is very frustrating.
"I have a big bill I need to pay in a few days, so after work I tried really hard to make money on mTurk to make up the difference."
"I hadn't been able to work out in awhile due to an injury, and I just bought a new set of weights I was excited to try out. Yesterday was really nice in feeling that I could start exercising again."
I had what felt like a rather long and frustrating work day yesterday. It felt like everthing was just dragging at work.
I had to work alone today and close at work. It was stressful because I was the only person at work. That meant I was in control of everything. I had to answer phone calls interact with customers and solve any issues that arose. It was stressful.
"I had to walk into a shitshow, where there was no support staff, multiple call-offs, and openers had walk-in assignments. I had to do twice as much as normal."
"I had to take my roommate to the hospital. We weren't sure whether she had a problem with her appendix, or maybe a urinary tract infection or kidney stones. She has no insurance so we had to go to the emergency room. Fortunately, they saw her within 30 minutes because she was in pain. It turned out she had kidney stones. I went back home and waited for her to call me. When she called, we had to go to the hospital pharmacy to pick up four prescriptions, which I had to pay for. Fortunately, since she is poor, they only cost $4 apiece. She went straight to bed when she got home."
I had to rest my leg all day because I have knee bursitis. So I couldn't really do much else but relax all day. It felt okay. Kinda boring though. Knee feeling better.
I had to rely on my faith in God to help get me through feelings I've had concerning a recent breakup.
I had to prepare a meal for 300 people. We had suppers at church that I am in charge of. It is a big job but it brings a sense of accomplishment.
I had the greatest dinner yesterday.  It was cooked perfectly and the seasoning was perfect.  I am sure to make a note of the recipe so that I can prepare the meal again.
I had the day off work so I had lots of time to hang out
I had sushi yesterday. It was good. It made me happy. It was tasty. It put me a in a good mood.
I had such an enjoyable meal yesterday. I had been craving it for so long. It was probably the highlight of my week.
I had spent most of my day yesterday working and the only salient thing I noticed I was really anxious. I wanted to get off and go home.
"I had some stomach pains all day that worried me. I spent most of the day googling what was wrong with me and unsurprisingly was met with results ranging from it could be gas, to it could be kidney stones."
I had sex with my wife wo I am trying to do more. It made me feel really good because sometimes I feel like I don't satisfy her enough.
"I had received an important email from an individual I had contacted last week, which they would reply a bit later than I had initially hoped for external reasons. I was glad to hear back from the person, and excited that they were willing to comply with my request. It made me feel relief/satisfaction, and happy that I could follow through with my plans."
I had prayed for direction from the Most High about my new business and he led me to just the right information I need to know. That made me excited.
"I had pizza from a place I did not have since childhood, it was an interesting experience."
"I had parent teacher conferences for two of my children. One was excellent and is doing really well and my oldest, is doing well academically but is struggling in the classroom and socially. He receives a lot of help at school and at home, but nothing seems to be working."
I had one of my days doing crowd sourcing work. I have been doing this 5 months and have recently hit 10000 hits. So I have been very pleased with this work and yesterday paid off. I was very happy and elated. Such a good emotional boost!
"I had not seen my brother for almost 5 years although we talk on Facebook daily.  It just happened although he is only 2 hours away.  Planned visits had been cancelled.  I saw him a few times a month before our Mom passed.  Yesterday, we met for coffee as he was down here for work.  I was so excited and happy to see him.  I think we are back on track now!!"
"I had my wisdom tooth extracted yesterday. It was the first one I've had to experience, so I was incredibly anxious."
I had friends over which felt great but I also had some social anxiety about it.
I had dinner with my mother and sister. We had a lot of fun.
"I had been sick for about 10 days and had not responded to treatment. So, I had to return to the doctor and seek a new direction in treatment."
I had an especially frustrating day at work yesterday and had to stay late to finish a project after the project file was corrupted and I lost a whole days work.
I had an amazing dinner with my family. Everybody was in a great mood and shared their news and what's going on in their lives
I had alot of work
"I had a very productive day today at work, and even picked up a new skill, which was nice.  I was very busy for most of the day, with almost no lulls, which made the day go by faster.  I feel satisfied and accomplished, which is something that doesn't happen often these days, so at the end of the day, it was a good day."
I had a very good sleep last night not as usual
"I had a really good workout yesterday. I start almost everyday with 90-120 minutes of excercise (I have missed 10 days this year) and yesterday was chest, shoulders, triceps and stair master. It was really hard and I made it through the entire thing. I was spent after and really liked the workout."
I had a really good dinner yesterday with my wife and my son. We were really able to relax and connect.
I had a nice dinner with my wife yesterday.  It was a good way to relax after a  hard day at work.  She always knows how to make me feel loved and appreciated.
"I had a medical appointment today, and was so relieved when all the tests came back showing that everything was good. No problems at all."
"I had a lot of work to get done yesterday and was quite apprehensive about whether I would be successful in completing it all. To my surprise and even with some interruptions, I was able to focus for a long period of time and get all my jobs done. I felt very satisfied and content when I left the office."
I had a lot going on at work and it all just started to come together really well.  I got a lot of loose ends tied up which helped me feel like things are getting better.  I was calm and cool and managed to do each task efficiently.  It really made me feel a sense of confidence and satisfaction knowing that things were going so well.
I had a long conversation with my Dad yesterday. It was interesting and enjoyable.
"I had a great workout the other day, it made me feel extremely refreshed."
I had a great meal with friends
i had a great day with my family yesterday
I had a great day out with my friend Jennifer
I had a great day at work and found out that I am going to get a substantial raise in the new year. That is always good news and goes to show that my hard work is paying off.
I had a great breakfast today. It gave me fuel for the day and tasted amazing.
"I had a good time with my kids after school. We played chess, ate dinner, had dessert, and watched a movie together."
"I had a good selection of tasks yesterday, and they exceeded my goals (in terms of hours worked and earnings.)  Knowing that the weather had turned cold and miserable, and that at the end of the week my work day's were going to be interrupted by other responsibilities, it was that much more satisfying that I could get more than the average amount of work accomplished yesterday.  I was also able to concentrate on/organize some upcoming chores and personal projects, especially some photography I want to accomplish. Earning more money now puts me at ease about missing some work time later this month when I pursue these types of personal projects."
"i had a good day that i hoped and prayed for. yestday morning i prayed to God that i wanted a good day and most of all a good profit to come out of my business. thank God for the answered prayer, i made some good deals yestday and today i'm a bit richer than i was."
"I got to work out, it was hard, but satisfying. This is something that i have been denying myself and I finally am doing it again. I am grateful and happy about it"
I got to talk with my parents. They called to tell me good news that my cousin got married and is having a baby. It was such a wonderful thing to hear.
I got to spend time with my family today which was important to me.
I got to spend time with my cousins Rachael and Emily.  We are very close and we enjoy watching television shows together.  We have snacks and laugh like there's no tomorrow.  I love them so much
"i got to spend the day with my wife, it was very refreshing to enjoy each others company."
I got to read the Bible and my favorite books on the subject of Christianity. It helped me become more at peace and loving towards myself and others.
I got to put christmas lights up with my wife and it was so fun!
"I got some rest that refreshed me after a tiring and bothersome day, so it was a nice step forward somewhat."
"I got in a good workout at the gym. Despite my injured knee, I worked out for almost an hour. I felt relaxed and good afterward. It was a good day."
"I found out yesterday that my relative has endometriosis cancer. Somewhat, we had a feeling about the result but it still made us sad and angry at the same time. She had the symptoms and when the doctor asked them to come earlier than the scheduled appointment, we kind of got the clue. I hope she can be treated and healed."
I found out yesterday I have a severe case of bronchitis. At first they thought it was pneumonia until the xray came back negative. I already deal with out of control asthma every day of my life. I'm confused how I got sick. I'm frustrated and upset/
"I found a recipe online and I made it.Sometimes my cooking is not very good, but this time ,it was excellent."
I found a new pokemon game edit online and I modified it to suit my needs. It was a nice time because I was able to figure out exactly what I wanted and a way to do it that circumvented my limitations in editing someone else's program.
I finally finished a hand beaded bracelet that I have been trying to learn for over a month. It made me feel great to have it done. It looks really cute too.
I felt very obligated
