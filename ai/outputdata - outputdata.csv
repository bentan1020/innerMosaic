"So yesterday, I spent most of my working time testing and debugging the new code I wrote to automatically log a user back in when they time out, AND run whatever command they were trying to run when the program realized they'd timed out. The login part works great! And the running the command part works too - as long as there's only ONE command. If a single action, like a click, triggers TWO commands - like for instance, if clicking anywhere in a widget selects it, and clicking a button within it also contacts the DB - then only the first one runs and I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY. I can't debug it because every time I pause the code to step through it, the behavior changes! I suppose that in itself helps me narrow it down some - it must be a timing issue in some way - but I'm really stumped. I'll work on it some more today, I guess. I hate bugs I can't trace well, I feel like I don't have a good handle on how to find them. I mostly just stare at the code until inspiration strikes.","1.
